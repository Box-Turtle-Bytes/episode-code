# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a .NET application (episode-15b) that demonstrates serverless architecture using AWS services. The application will consist of a DynamoDB table for data storage and a Lambda function written in .NET that can read data from the table. This serves as a foundational example of .NET serverless development on AWS.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a DynamoDB table through infrastructure as code, so that I have a persistent data store for my .NET Lambda function.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the infrastructure is deployed THEN the system SHALL create a DynamoDB table with appropriate configuration
2. WHEN the table is created THEN the system SHALL configure proper read/write capacity settings
3. WHEN the table is created THEN the system SHALL define a primary key structure suitable for the application
4. IF the table already exists THEN the system SHALL handle the deployment gracefully without errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a .NET Lambda function, so that I can execute serverless code that interacts with DynamoDB.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Lambda function is deployed THEN the system SHALL create a .NET-based Lambda function
2. WHEN the function is invoked THEN the system SHALL successfully connect to the DynamoDB table
3. WHEN the function executes THEN the system SHALL be able to read data from the DynamoDB table
4. WHEN the function completes THEN the system SHALL return appropriate response data
5. IF the DynamoDB table is empty THEN the function SHALL handle this scenario gracefully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper IAM permissions configured, so that my Lambda function can securely access the DynamoDB table.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the infrastructure is deployed THEN the system SHALL create IAM roles with least-privilege access
2. WHEN the Lambda function executes THEN the system SHALL have permission to read from the DynamoDB table
3. WHEN accessing DynamoDB THEN the system SHALL NOT have unnecessary permissions beyond what's required
4. IF permission is denied THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application organized in a proper folder structure, so that the code is maintainable and follows .NET conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is created THEN the system SHALL organize files in an episode-15b directory
2. WHEN examining the structure THEN the system SHALL include proper .NET project files and configuration
3. WHEN building the project THEN the system SHALL include all necessary dependencies for AWS SDK
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL include infrastructure as code files for AWS resources

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want sample data operations, so that I can see the Lambda function working with real DynamoDB interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Lambda function runs THEN the system SHALL demonstrate reading data from DynamoDB
2. WHEN no data exists THEN the system SHALL handle empty table scenarios appropriately
3. WHEN data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL format the response in a readable manner
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and logging
